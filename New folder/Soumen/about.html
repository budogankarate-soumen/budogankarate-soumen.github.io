                  <h1>The Sensei :</h1><br>
                  <p>Hello Everyone.. I am Soumen. Graduated from C.U. with specialization in Chemistry Hons.<br>
                     Despite being in a normal bengali family and normal career which, everyvody wants to have, I always dreamt of learning martial arts. While working for a chemical company in Assam, I started my "training" on my own because that time I could not really afford a trainer. Started with some videos that I collected from a friend of mine. It was going good. Eventually I met a guy who was directly involved with a Karate School. You know as they say, <b>"Desire anything from the core of your heart, keep your will power strong and you will get it.."</b><br>
                     Then I never looked back. Now I am a Black Belt. I came back to Kolkata and left my job. Only with one goal in my mind.<b>"I want to teach martial arts to all and specially to them who desire to learn it but do not have the financial means."</b><br>
                     All are welcome to my school. <b>AGE IS NEVER A BARRIER IN THE PATH OF LEARING</b>.
                     Join Us.. Let's make a better India..

                  <h1>The Author :</h1><br>
                  <p> I am Joy. B.Tech professional currently working in a MNC.<br>
                      Me and Soumen were in same school. But geographical distance is never a factor in between our friendship. When he came up with this idea I was really happy about the fact that at least one of us is chasing his dream.<br>
                      As per he asked I created this website. Because now a days online publicity matters. I am no black belt karate master but I know this, it helps you build an inner power you can never imagine of.
